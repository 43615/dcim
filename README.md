# dcim [WIP]
### *dc improved: Feature-added rewrite of a 50+ year old RPN calculator/stack machine/programming language*

Features present in GNU dc are not listed unless different. [Familiarize yourself first.](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dc)

This is my first real Rust project, please expect low quality and report anything weird. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Planned upcoming features/changes:
- Number output fix
- More conversion factors
## General changes and notes
- Default (interactive) mode now has a prompt indicator.
- The file and expression modes now accept and execute any number of arguments. If the last expression or filename is `?`, it will enter interactive mode after finishing.
- Error messages are (hopefully) more helpful and always prefixed with `!`.
- Commands that need integers always explicitly round their arguments. When rounding, the fractional part is discarded (rounding towards zero).
- The amount of registers provided is now fixed to 65536, meaning that any character on Unicode's Basic Multilingual Plane can be used as a register name.
- The default value when saving or loading uninitialized array objects is the number 0. This fixes the issue with `123d:ala`.
- The `!` command for executing OS commands is deliberately not implemented.
## Number input changes
- Both the input and output bases are now in the range 2-36 (inclusive).
- Capital A-F are no longer used for number input in the normal way, base-11+ numbers now need to be escaped with `'`. This change frees up A-F to be used as commands and allows for bases over 16.
  - Example: `'_123orletters.ANYCASE789` (ends on any character that doesn't continue the number, space recommended).
- Digits too high for the input base (such as `'G` when base is 16) are not parsed, but always cause an error message instead.
## Precision and number output changes
- The precision parameter has been split into output precision (`k`/`K`) and working/mantissa precision (`w`/`W`).
- Output precision now applies correctly regardless of output base.
- If output precision is negative (default: -1), numbers are printed with enough precision to be exact (reproducible by inputting what's printed).
- If it's not, up to K digits are printed after the point. Sufficiently small or large numbers are displayed in scientific notation like `-123.456@-789`.
- Working precision (default: 256) determines the mantissa size of all newly created numbers. 256 bits can store about 75 decimal digits accurately. For comparison: an IEEE 754 `double` has a 53-bit mantissa. Scale is unlimited within reason.
  - Tip: The amount of bits you need for a certain level of precision can be estimated using `<prec> <base> 2G*`. Always add a little more.
- Floating-point rounding artifacts are guaranteed unless the number is a binary fraction or the output base is a power of 2. This is an unavoidable problem, GNU dc just hid it from view by storing numbers in the base they were created in.
- Attention: W applies to the whole number, so large integers may be represented incorrectly. The default corresponds to a generous "i257".
- `X` is not implemented because it doesn't make sense for binary floats.
## New feature: Parameter stack
- `{` switches to a new "parameter context" with defaults `_1k 10i 10o` while keeping the previous one.
- `}` restores the previous context or resets the parameters to default if no previous context exists.
- Working precision is unaffected.
## New mathematical commands and changes
- `^` no longer rounds the exponent.
- `V`: bth root of a.
- `g`: natural log of a.
- `G`: bth log of a, effectively a shorthand for `<a>g <b>g /`.
- `uyt`, `UYT`: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan. Arguments in radians.
- All modulo operators (`%`, `~`, `|`) now round their arguments.
- `N` pushes a random integer in range \[0;a).
## New stack/register manipulation commands
- `C` deletes the top a elements.
- `D` duplicates the top a elements.
- `Z`\<reg\> now pushes the depth of a register.
- `F`\<reg\> now prints an entire register.
- `R` rotates the top abs(a) elements: upward if a is positive, downward if negative.
  - Example: `1 2 3 4 3R` results in 1 4 2 3.
## New/overloaded string manipulation commands
- `+` concatenates two strings.
- `-` removes abs(b) characters from string a: from the back if b is positive, from the front if negative.
  - Example: `[abcde]_2-` results in "cde".
- `*` repeats string a abs(b) times, flipping it if b is negative.
- `/` removes characters from string a such that abs(b) remain: from the back if b is positive, from the front if negative.
  - Example: `[vwxyz]_2/` results in "yz".
- `a` now uses the least significant 32 bits.
- `A` converts a number to a string in 32-bit blocks corresponding to characters, similarly to `P`(which parses bytes as UTF-8).
## Manual register number selection
- `,` writes a number to a single-use manual register number selector and marks it as valid.
- This selector can only be written to and expires (becomes invalid) at the next call of any register command.
- When it's valid, register commands don't process the next character as a register name.
- Example: `[test] sa 97,l p` (assuming input base is 10).
- If no register name is provided and the selector is marked as invalid, an error message is displayed.
- Advantages/use cases:
  - Enables scripts to select registers automatically without having to convert the number to a string first (`123,s` is shorter than `123a[s]r+x`).
  - Register numbers can be input in any base because the number is parsed like any other.
  - All register numbers in the allowed range can be used, not just valid/inputtable Unicode characters.
## Macro changes
- `q` now always exits regardless of where it's called from.
- `Q` may behave slightly differently, TODO: test.
## New feature: Library of constants and conversion factors
TODO: List all factors
- `"` pushes the constant or conversion factor with name a.
- The name may also be two names separated by a space. This is a shorthand for converting from one unit to another.
  - Example: `90[deg]"*` converts 90Â° to radians, `10 6^[in nmi]"*` converts 1 million inches to nautical miles.
- All constants and units are stored in amounts of their respective international standard units.
# Memory model diagram
dc's manpage doesn't do a great job at explaining it, so here's a diagram:
```
Basic object "Obj":
+--------+
| String |
+--------+
| Number |
+--------+
|  Type  |
+--------+
Boolean "Type" (true iff string) solely determines how an object is treated. The thereby "activated" field must not be empty, the other one is never used.

Main stack:
+-----+-----+-----+----
| Obj | Obj | Obj | ... no theoretical size limit
+-----+-----+-----+----

Register object "RegObj":
+-----+
| Obj | principal object (s/l)
+-----+-----+-----+----
| Obj | Obj | Obj | ... array of objects (:/;), no theoretical size limit
+-----+-----+-----+----
Each RegObj has its own array.
Note that arrays are continuous (all lower indices are always valid to read from).
Writing to or reading from an uninitialized array element initializes all previously nonexistent Objs with the number 0.

Register:
+--------+--------+--------+----
| RegObj | RegObj | RegObj | ... no theoretical size limit
+--------+--------+--------+----
s and l overwrite and copy the top RegObj's Obj, S and L push and pop the whole RegObj.

Array of all registers:
+----------+----------+----------+-----+----------+
| Register | Register | Register | ... | Register | size fixed to 65536
+----------+----------+----------+-----+----------+
```
