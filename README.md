### *dc improved - Expanded rewrite of a classic RPN calculator / esoteric programming language*

This readme only mentions changes compared to GNU dc. If you're unfamiliar with its core principles, read its man page or [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dc_(computer_program)).

[**Complete documentation in the wiki**](https://github.com/43615/dcim/wiki)

## Building
(Assuming complete and up-to-date Rust environment)

### In general
```shell
cargo install dcim
```

### Windows
`gmp-mpfr-sys` requires some extra setup, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.rs/gmp-mpfr-sys/latest/gmp_mpfr_sys/#building-on-windows). After building it in MinGW once, new dc:im versions can be built normally until I update it to a new version of `gmp-mpfr-sys`.

Note: Numbers with huge mantissae (W≥2³⁰) cause crashes for some arcane internal reason I can't control. If you want to calculate something to a billion digits, use WSL.

### Android (Termux)
This seems to be required for Rust in general:
```shell
export RUSTFLAGS=" -C link-arg=$(clang -print-libgcc-file-name)"
```
Install:
```shell
MAKEFLAGS="-i" cargo install dcim
```
The current version of GNU MPFR fails one inconsequential test (no idea why), use `-i` to pretend it doesn't happen.

## Most important changes compared to GNU dc
- New commands for easier stack/register manipulation and macro execution.
- Expanded shell argument syntax, run `dcim -h` to learn more.
- Error messages are much more helpful and differentiated, and are always prefixed with `! `.
- When type/semantic errors occur, all used objects are returned to the stack.
- Numbers are binary floats with arbitrary precision (parameter `W`). The parameter `K` only applies to output.
- Strings have full Unicode support (stored in UTF-8).
- Improved and new arithmetic commands.
- Full suite of string manipulation commands, including a regex engine.
- Number input/output bases are unlimited upwards, bases above 36 use a custom "any-base" notation.
- The amount of available registers is unlimited.
- Arbitrary registers can be selected with a "register pointer" command.
- Commands for multithreaded macro execution.
- A library of various named constants and unit conversion factors.

## Using dc:im as a library
[Crate documentation (autogenerated)](https://docs.rs/dcim/latest/dcim/)
- The main point of this is to connect the logic to a different set of IO streams.
- You could also use it to calculate something for your program, manually extracting the results from the `State` afterwards.
